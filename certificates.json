Students who complete the prescribed requirements are awarded a certificate in Applied and Computational Mathematics. Recently a new option has become available to undergraduate math majors who intend to pursue the PACM certificate, the applied math track.",

Additionally, certificate earners are encouraged to make African American people, literature, history, or related study and/or research in African American Studies central to their senior thesis topic. PDF courses cannot be counted toward your certificate requirements (not including P/D/F Only courses).",

Many students have found this program an effective way to apply computer science to their own specialties, and to understand how computing concepts and technology are changing our world.",
