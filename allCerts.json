	"description" : "The Program in Applications of Computing (link is external)(PAC) is an interdisciplinary program designed for students who want to combine the study of computing and computers beyond an introductory level with another academic concentration, but who are not concentrating in computer science. The program welcomes students in all disciplines, including both areas traditionally making heavy use of computation (such as engineering, the physical sciences, economics, and mathematics) and emerging application areas (such as biology, cognitive science, graphic arts, music, history, philosophy, politics, sociology, literature, and so on). Many students have found this program an effective way to apply computer science to their own specialties, and to understand how computing concepts and technology are changing our world.",

It is encouraged, but not required, that this process lead to the actual creation of an entrepreneurial enterprise.  Expectations of the practicum are as follows:\n\nThe student will develop a novel hypothesis in the practicum project, not one that they have already developed in class.  \nWhile the project may be supported through existing programs such as the eLab summer accelerator (for at least one summer full-time) and Tiger Challenge (for at least one year), it can happen independently of these.\nThroughout the process, students should receive the mentorship of either faculty members or entrepreneurial mentors the University has identified.\n The project proposal and the “final product” both would be reviewed by a committee appointed by the program director.  Potential end users for this product/ service could also be on the committee.  \nThe final presentation to the committee would not be a traditional investor pitch, but rather a discussion of how the hypothesis was derived and how the practical testing and prototype development and deployment was carried out.  The evaluation of the practicum leads to a pass/fail result and would focus primarily on the process of entrepreneurial endeavor.",
