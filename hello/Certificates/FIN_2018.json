            "explanation": "As economic theory, mathematics, and probability and statistics are pervasive in modern financial analysis, completion of the certificate in finance requires mathematical ability and preparation. The following foundation courses, or their equivalent, are required for admission into the program and (except as noted) must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. ECO and ORF majors require a higher level of proficiency in the prerequisite courses to ensure that the independent work is sufficiently quantitative. Consequently, ECO and ORF majors must have a minimum average grade of B- calculated across all prerequisites. All courses require a letter grade (pass/fail not allowed).",
