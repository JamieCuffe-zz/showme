    "description": "Under the auspices of the Bendheim Center for Finance (link is external), Princeton undergraduates concentrating in any department may earn a certificate that attests to their proficiency in the discipline of finance. The rapidly developing field of finance focuses on the pricing of financial assets, including equities, bonds, currencies, and derivative securities; portfolio management and the evaluation of financial risks; banking and financial intermediation; the financing of corporations; corporate governance; financial-market and banking regulation; and many other topics. In addition to the obvious practical relevance of finance, the field contains both challenging intellectual problems and a distinctive formal framework within which those problems can be addressed. Knowledge of modern finance is also essential to the proper understanding of many other topics in economics and public policy, including the determination of exchange rates and international capital flows, the making of monetary and fiscal policy, the role of financial reform in developing and transition economies, the regulation and taxation of financial markets and financial instruments, and antitrust policy. Finally, modern finance is remarkably eclectic, drawing from many disciplines besides economics, including mathematics, operations research, engineering, computer science, psychology, politics, and history.",

The following foundation courses, or their equivalent, are required for admission into the program and (except as noted) must be completed by the end of the sophomore year. ECO and ORF majors require a higher level of proficiency in the prerequisite courses to ensure that the independent work is sufficiently quantitative. Consequently, ECO and ORF majors must have a minimum average grade of B- calculated across all prerequisites. All courses require a letter grade (pass/fail not allowed).",
