HUM courses explore interrelated events, ideas, texts, and artifacts of Western and Asian cultures. Students in these courses may work toward a certificate in interdisciplinary studies in the humanities. Journalism courses (subject area JRN) examine topics related to writing and the media, from creative nonfiction to relations between the media and society. Both kinds of courses are described below.",
