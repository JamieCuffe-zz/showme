  "description": "Earning a certificate in African American Studies is a straightforward and enriching course of study which complements, and complicates, any Princeton concentration. Students who opt to pursue a certificate in African American Studies gain access to an extraordinary bibliography that prepares them to think about race and difference in sophisticated ways. Certificate earners are required to complete 5 units of coursework, which include AAS 201; two survey courses; and two additional subfield courses. Additionally, certificate earners are encouraged to make African American people, literature, history, or related study and/or research in African American Studies central to their senior thesis topic. PDF courses cannot be counted toward your certificate requirements (not including P/D/F Only courses).",

    "description" : "The Program in Creative Writing, part of the Lewis Center for the Arts, allows undergraduates to work with practicing writers while pursuing a regular liberal arts course of study. Students develop their writing skills; learn the possibilities of modern poetry, fiction, nonfiction, screenwriting, and translation; and gain a special access to the critical understanding of literature through their involvement in the creative process. Small workshop courses in poetry, fiction, nonfiction, screenwriting, and translation are taught by the program faculty, and visiting writers. These courses are limited in enrollment to ensure the benefits of working closely with faculty. Students begin the creative writing course sequence in either the fall or spring with 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 348, 349, or 448. (Any of these may be repeated for credit with a different instructor.) Students who have taken two 200-level courses in poetry, fiction, and translation may apply for the 300 level. All creative writing courses require an application process. Screenwriting students may apply to intermediate and advanced screenwriting classes after one introductory screenwriting class, or any other two CWR courses.Each workshop focuses on one genre only (poetry, fiction, nonfiction, screenwriting, or translation). Workshops meet for up to three hours weekly and are devoted primarily to discussion of student work. All creative writing program courses are graded pass/D/fail but are not counted in the pass/D/fail budget.",

The interface between engineering science and the life sciences is an area of dramatic growth and intellectual vigor. Innovations and new developments in this area require multidisciplinary approaches and greater exposure to life science and engineering science fundamentals than is available from a single department. For engineering majors, in addition to courses in those subjects fundamental to the student's major, the program encourages the study of cellular and molecular biology, genetics, physiology, biochemistry, and neuroscience. For biological and chemical sciences majors, the program offers study in biotechnology, biomechanics, thermodynamics, control theory, hazardous waste management, electronics, computer graphics, and information theory.",

This new field of “data science” is interdisciplinary, merging contributions from a variety of disciplines to address numerous applied problems. The program provides students with a set of tools required for addressing these emerging challenges. Through the program, students will learn basic theoretical frameworks and apply statistics and machine learning methods to many problems of interest.",

Courses must be taken for a letter grade, no Pass/D/Fail or Audit. At the discretion of the Departmental Representative, students who study abroad during the academic year may count one pre-approved course per semester abroad towards the certificate. One Princeton summer abroad course offered through the department would also count. Two pre-approved courses in a summer program abroad other than Princeton's can count as one course towards the certificate.  In no case, however, can more than two courses taken abroad count toward the certificate. Any Spanish course taught in English will require all written work to be completed in Spanish in order to count towards the certificate.",
