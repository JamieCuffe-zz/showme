Students who complete the prescribed requirements are awarded a certificate in Applied and Computational Mathematics. Recently a new option has become available to undergraduate math majors who intend to pursue the PACM certificate, the applied math track.",

Certificate earners are required to complete 5 units of coursework, which include AAS 201; two survey courses; and two additional subfield courses. Additionally, certificate earners are encouraged to make African American people, literature, history, or related study and/or research in African American Studies central to their senior thesis topic. PDF courses cannot be counted toward your certificate requirements (not including P/D/F Only courses).",
